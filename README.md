### LinkVertise Bypass

Are you just tired of looking at LinkVertise vids? Because I am, that is why I created this Tampermonkey Script. It automatically fetches for the LinkVertise REST to find the target URL and then redirects you to it. Most of the times it takes somewhere between 3-5 seconds to redirect you completely as there is some REST involved, that depends purely of your internet connection.

### How to Install:

Install TamperMonkey at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=pt

#### Automatically:

  Open the GreasyFork url: https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/400965-easy-bypass;
  Click on the button "Install Script";
  Enjoy it.
  
#### Manually:

  Create a new script called "LinkedVertise Bypass" or "Easy Bypass";
  Open the file in this github called "main.js";
  Copy the content of the file and paste it on the script you created;
  Enjoy it.
